# Chatbot-for-analysing-legal-documents-
## Description
Large language models and generative artificial intelligence have revolutionized juvenile justice. This paper has added to the assessment of the potential uses, advantages, and challenges associated with the integration of Gen AI and LLMs into juvenile justice systems. The study will contrastively analyze some of the models available through Huggingface—like Llama3 and Gemma—based on their competencies and efficiency in enhancing rehabilitative strategies, facilitating legal processes, and boosting decision-making. Besides, it investigates the design of a multi-agent framework conceived to enhance the Q&A functionality of chatbots by using those three models for smooth and coherent interactions. A number of ethical concerns that such sophisticated AI systems bring along are discussed in the paper, along with technological constraints. This paper discusses the potential of Gen AI and LLM in transforming fairness and effectiveness within juvenile justice based on extensive literature review and real-world case studies.

## Key takeaways
1.	Exploring and efficiently summarizing juvenile legal documents for faster preprocessing of documents 
2.	The chatbot helps in querying multiple documents at once, and get relevant answers as quick responses.
3.	A comparative  study of the three models used is done , for better accuracy, faster embedding process and relevant information.
4. Inbuilt metagpt-driven multiagent framework: A multiagent framework is especially            useful in the context of a chatbot for juvenile justice. In it, one agent deals with questions concerning legal rights and procedures, another concentrates on offering counseling and emotional support, and a third provides information about programs for rehabilitation. This division of labor will enhance the overall efficacy of the chatbot toward just and efficient juvenile justice procedures by fully catering to the experience of all users according to their individual needs.
